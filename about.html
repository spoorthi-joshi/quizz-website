Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and skills, or simply as a hobby. They can also be televised for entertainment purposes, often in a game show format.

Quizzes are often used in North American higher education environments to briefly test a students' level of comprehension regarding course material, providing teachers with insights into student progress and any existing knowledge gaps.</h4></p>
